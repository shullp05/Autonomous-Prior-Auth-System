(only these patterns and their clear derivations/abbreviations count as satisfying BMI/diagnosis criteria)

GENERAL NOTES:
- Height/weight that clearly calculate to the thresholds below count the same as explicit BMI.
- Diagnosis strings include BOTH free-text labels and structured problem-list / ICD-based text.
